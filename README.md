<h1>BlocJams</h1>

Welcome to Bloc Jams, a digital music player like Spotify a frontend web project. We started the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript.

To make Bloc Jams more dynamic, we used vanilla JavaScript â€“ no bells, no whistles, just JavaScript in its purest form. DOM scripting is "lightweight," as it requires no libraries that may slow page performance.

Experience with DOM scripting is essential, but frontend developers require knowledge of at least a few common libraries. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library today. We used it to refactor the vanilla JavaScript we've implemented for the Bloc Jams landing page.

jQuery is a great tool for adding animations and effects to a page, but it's difficult to build a sophisticated frontend application with jQuery alone. In this project, again we have  refactored Bloc Jams using AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular.
